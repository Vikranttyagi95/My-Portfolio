## A personal website using Flask

- In this project, I have built a website using python web framework "Flask" on the backend.
- The website has a home page, works page, about page and contact page.
- On the contact page visitors can enter their email and message and these are stored in a csv file on the backend.
- After building it i deployed it on pythonanywhere.com
